==============================================
ASSUMPTIONS:

0) python:
-> python2.7 installed (for grader)
-> python3.7/3.6 installed (for poller)

1) config:

    We assume a file config (there is a template in config.temp).
    It should contain a JSON object with the following fields:
    - "baseurl": the URL to the restapi the server should poll from.
         e.g. for local testing: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/restapi/"
    - "token": the token for authentification with the restapi
    - "port": the port at which isabelle server should listen to
    - "sessions": a list of sessions that should be prebuilt and stored as
        heaps for faster checking of theories, e.g. ["Pure", "HOL"]
    - "ITP": a string containing the Isabelle version, e.g. "Isabelle2019"
    - "ITPshort": a short string denoting the Isabelle version.
         ISA for Isabelle 2018, I19 for Isabelle 2019, and counting
    - "pythonversion": the python version that should be used for the poller
    - "pwd": the password for connecting to Isabelle server, will be set when
         starting up the server
    - "logger-level": the level of messages the logger should write to files.
         either "INFO", "DEBUG" or "ERROR",

2) in the home folder you should have tarballs containing the Isabelle versions
    you would like to support, e.g. Isabelle2018.tar.gz, Isabelle2019.tar.gz

3) in your home folder you should have an extracted version of the Isabelle
    version you want to use.

4) Firejail is installed

5) folders and rights:
    - /var/lib/isabelle-grader must exist and be readable

==============================================
HOW TO Prepare the server

0) preparation steps:

- copy config.temp to config
- add the right "baseurl", "token", "ITP", and so on
- make sure the Isabelle tarball you want to use is in your home folder,
    e.g. ~/Isabelle2018 should contain Isabelle 2018
- /var/lib/isabelle-grader must exist and be writeable

1) sudo ./judge prepare

    start with sudo, as a networknamespace must be generated

    this will happen:
    - config is read
    - important files will be copied to /var/lib/isabelle-grader/ISABELLEVERSION
    - the sessions will be pre built
    - if Isabelle2018 is used, we pull from the semantics1819 repo and build it
    - heaps are copied to 
        /var/lib/isabelle-grader/ISABELLEVERSION/.isabelle/ISABELELVERSION/heaps
    - a new networknamespace is created for communication with Isabelle server

==============================================
HOW TO START THE SERVER (Isabelle Server + Poller)

1) start the server 

> ./judge start 
   
    starts the server
    - first isabelle server is booting up, it will eventually emit a password
    - then the poller is started (it depends on the password)

2) get status of server

> ./judge status

3) stop the server

> ./judge stop

==============================================
LOGGING files to monitor

1) poller.log

    stuff the poller emits
    you can watch the start up and some logging when being in the 
    polling loop. also results from individual assessments

2) server.log
      
    stuff the Isabelle server emits,
    mainly while start up.

3) grader.log

    stuff the grader emits,

4) watchdog.log
    
    stuff the watchdog emits
